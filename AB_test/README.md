# AB test and results study
This project aims to demonstrate knowledge in the field of A/B testing, as well as to show new methods of analysis.

Statistical criteria used to assess the differences between two independent samples were applied:
1. T-Test
2. Mannâ€“Whitney U test

Various methods have also been applied to improve our performance to confirm our findings:
1. Smoothing CTR
2. Bootstrap
3. Bucket conversion
4. Linearization

# Basic hypothysis
The ML team has made some new algorithms for news recommendations in the feed. We need to check that our metric CTR has increased after the update.
